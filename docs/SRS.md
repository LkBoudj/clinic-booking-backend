üìù Note: Future Integration ‚Äì GOSI (Saudi Social Insurance)
The system is expected to potentially support integration with GOSI (General Organization for Social Insurance) in Saudi Arabia.

To accommodate this:

The User schema may later include a field such as gosi_number to store the social insurance number.

Additional tables such as gosi_records or insurance_claims may be added to track work-related injuries, claims, or contributions.

Ensure the database and system architecture are designed with modularity and flexibility to allow for future expansion without breaking existing functionality.

Status: Not required in the current phase, but should be considered in data modeling and system architecture decisions.
